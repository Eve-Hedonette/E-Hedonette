Before taking this class, I thought I had a fair amount of knowledge about the digital humanities. I thought of things like e-books, podcasts, visual novels, and virtual music artists, but this class has taught me that there is so much more to it than those few things. At the start of the semester, I defined Digital Humanities as “The humanities being applied in a digital format to help enhance them and make use of digital tools unavailable in the past to conduct research.” But that definition quickly changed; my perspective was broadened by the instruction of my professor. Now, I define Digital Humanities as “The combination of the humanities with various types of digital formats that can enhance them, or create new ways of experiencing the humanities that are only possible through technology.” I’ve come to realize that digital humanities are not just the digitization of materials from traditional formats, rather, it is the utilization of digital tools to create something new. Through the use of technology, we can create something new, something that can only exist with the contributions of digital and traditional materials.

The assignment that really opened my eyes to the uniqueness of this field of study was the TEI encoding project. When I started that project it felt as if I was just making a transcript, only instead of handwriting, I was typing. Then, I had an epiphany. While I was overlooking the code I wrote for my project a thought crossed my mind, “This couldn’t exist without technology.” It was so simple, but it made so much sense. I realized that making a digital edition was more than just transcribing a book, it was putting something out there on the internet for anyone to see. Unlike a traditional novel, an uncountable number of people could read the exact same text, maybe even at the same time. That realization altered my entire perception of digital humanities and what they are, and I’m glad that it did. Without that realization, I don’t think I would have enjoyed the class as much as I have. That being said, there were some parts of the class that I felt could have been improved. Specifically, the readings.

Some of the readings felt like they didn’t provide much information or knowledge that I as a student needed to know, or they reiterated knowledge that I knew already. For example, Kate Meyers’ “Manage Your Digital Identity” felt like it was harping on information I already knew as a college student. While I understand that it is important to reiterate that keeping your digital identity professional and unproblematic, but I don’t think I required a whole reading for that. Also Annette Vee’s “Programing as Literacy.” Given the course's stronger focus on the humanities portion of digital humanities (writing blogs, doing reviews, and writing the grant), this reading didn’t hold much value to me as a student. I feel like the importance of programming literacy is something most students are aware of considering how big a part technology plays in our lives. However, there were a few readings that I felt were very helpful. “Shitty First Drafts” by Anne Lamott made me feel reassured about my draft writing, and Gorsevski’s, “What Goes Inside a Typical Grant Proposal” gave me a good amount of guidance in designing the outline of my grant draft. I feel like I would have benefitted from more readings like those focused on what we are doing in class.

Overall, I think this class has helped me grow greatly as a writer. The grant project especially. It introduced me to a new style of writing that was neither academic nor informal but was still professional. After graduating I intend to enter the workforce doing work in marketing. The grant helped me learn how to be a convincing writer, and convey my emotions through my writing without being too casual. I also greatly appreciated the freedom that my professor gave me in choosing my grant topic. Most of my classes give a limited scope for choices when it comes to projects, but I actually was asked to think of multiple different ideas I would enjoy doing. It made a project that very easily could have been boring into something I had a personal interest in. I took this class just to fulfill my writing-intensive requirements but it turned out to be one of my favorite classes of the semester, and I would gladly take this course again if I had the opportunity.
