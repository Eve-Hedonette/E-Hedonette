Visual Haggard is a Digital Humanities project that archives the illustrations of popular Victorian novelist H. Rider Haggard. Created and moderated by Kate Holterhoff, the goal of this project is to preserve these images as well as make them more accessible to the public. It is not a complete archive as access to physical copies of his illustrations is scarce and some fell out of print over one hundred years ago. Even still, it is a substantial record of Haggard’s illustrations with over one hundred unique images.

The Home page gives visitors a summary of what the goal of the project is as well as detailed instructions on how to navigate through the site. Across the top of the page, there are four different tabs to choose from depending on what/how someone wishes to view the archive:

- The Novels tab categorizes each illustration by the novel that it was created for in alphabetical order. When you click on each image it gives a brief summary of the novel as well as some history of the novel’s publication. Below that there is also a list of the various editions of the novel that have been published.
- The Illustrators tab contains an alphabetical list of illustrators who have created images for Haggard’s novels. There is a master-list near the top of the page of all the names enabling fast navigation, but there is also a list that provides an example image of the illustrator’s work. When a name is clicked on it brings you to another smaller archive of this artist’s work, and may also have a small biography.
- The Biography tab gives a very detailed history of Haggard’s life and career all the way from birth to death, addresses his problematic views, and explains running themes within his collection of works. 
- The Editor’s Statement is a small essay written by the project director Kate Holterhoff detailing her reasoning behind creating this project, her history with studying Haggard’s works, and what credentials she has to be maintaining this archive. 

While the site is very well organized there are some discrepancies between each tab and what they provide readers. For example, there is the master-list of illustrator names at the top of its page but the Novels tab lacks this same feature. When finding an illustration via its novel the description of the image does not credit the illustrator who created it. This is a problem since it can create confusion for those who are unfamiliar with Haggard and may cause them to believe he created all of these illustrations. The descriptions of the images also contain misleading information about their publication. For example, in the description of Allan and the Ice Gods it talks about the first UK edition being published in 1927. However, when looking at the different editions, it says that it was first published in 1920.

This lack of clarity also carries over into the descriptions of the Illustrators. There is a varying amount of information for each person. Some have detailed accounts of the person's background and their art. Others have just a single line saying where they published their work frequently. Then there are some that do not even have any description, just a link to the picture that they created. This disparity, in combination with the other issues mentioned above, makes the archive seem a little unreliable as a source of historical information.

But the biggest issue I find with this project lies in its accessibility. One of the main purposes of this project is to improve accessibility to these illustrations for the public, but the page does not properly open on a mobile device. When visiting the site on a mobile browser it is impossible to leave the home screen. The tabs across the top of the page are not there, nor is there any link on the home page itself that leads to the archive. The only function available is the search bar which formats results in a hard-to-read, smushed-together format with no image, and bizarre results that seem to make no sense.

Though this project needs substantial improvement I believe that it has the potential to become an incredible resource for those interested in Haggard’s work. There is a substantial amount of images related to Haggard’s work and it is clear that Holterhoff is trying hard to make this archive as educational as possible.
