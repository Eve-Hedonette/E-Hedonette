For my TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) project I was given a passage from Bram Stoker’s short story _Dracula’s Guest_ to become familiar with coding and simultaneously contribute to a project that my professor is a part of. _Dracula’s Guest_ was actually meant to be a part of Stoker’s novel _Dracula_ but was cut out due to concerns about the novel’s length it was taken out, only to be published posthumously in 1914 by Stoker’s wife. For my portion of the project, I was tasked with coding a passage from pages 16-17 by using an XML (Extensible Markup Language) editor called _Oxygen_. 

My professor first gave us our passages using Google Docs and instructed us on what we needed to mark since various things like paragraphs, quotes, em-dashes, etc. all needed to have specific tags when transferred into _Oxygen_. Before this project, I had a vague familiarity with coding from classes I took early in high school so I wasn’t totally lost, but I also knew that a  simple mistake could easily ruin an entire script of code so I was a bit anxious. On top of that I ended up having to miss the class period dedicated to teaching everyone how to use the program, so I felt that I was going to be lagging behind everyone else. Surprisingly, that was not the case.

It was very easy to translate my passage from plain text to code, the system of tagging I am actually familiar with because of an app called _Amino_ which uses a similar system for their blogs. On my own time, I inserted all the appropriate tags for my passage, and when I went to class all I had to do was copy and paste it into the program and I was done.

The only issue I had was the quotation marks not being registered, which was easily resolved since my professor announced at the beginning of class how to fix that. Within less than ten minutes I had a very professional and functional piece of encoded literature.

All in all, it was a very easy and interesting experience that definitely dulled my fears of coding. It also reinforced my belief that attention to detail can make or break some projects, and that it never hurts to be extra thorough when reviewing your work. I’m very glad I got to work on this project.
