# Hello! My name is Eve Hedonette. 

I am a senior English major at Christopher Newport University graduating in May of this year, and my pronouns are She/Her. I enrolled in this class to fulfill a degree requirement but I am also interested in becoming more digitally literate and seeing how the humanities have developed in a digital space.

I am working towards entering the field of technical writing as a stepping stone towards my larger goals. My dream is to become involved with multimedia creative projects such as *Hypnosis Mic*, *Critical Role*, Augmented Reality Games, etc. I have always enjoyed writing and creating stories for others to read, but I feel the written word cannot fully express the things I wish to share.

I am a cosplayer and I regularly visit pop culture conventions in my area when I can safely do so. I also enjoy dancing and frequently combine my passion for costuming and performance to create choreography and performances to post to my social media. My best friends and I also regularly get together and play tabletop games together which turn into inspiration for much of my writing, and is the source of many, many memes. Maybe Iâ€™ll share those with you later.
