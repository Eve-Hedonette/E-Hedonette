Visual Haggard is a Digital Humanities project that archives the illustrations of popular Victorian novelist H. Rider Haggard. Created and moderated by Kate Holterhoff, the goal of this project is to preserve these images as well as make them more accessible to the public. It is not a complete archive as access to physical copies of his illustrations is scarce and some fell out of print over one hundred years ago. Even still, it is a substantial record of Haggard’s illustrations with over one hundred unique images.

The Home page gives a summary of the project's goal and easy instructions on how to navigate the site. Across the top of the page, there are four different tabs to choose from depending on what/how someone wishes to view the archive:

- The Novels tab categorizes each illustration by the novel that it belongs to. When you click on each image it gives a brief summary of the novel as well as some history of the novel’s publication. Below that there is also a list of the various editions of the novel published over the years.
- The Illustrators tab categorizes the illustrations by the artist who created them. There are many ways to navigate this tab. Near the top of the page is a master list of names for fast navigation. Below is a list of their names with an image attached for readers who may know their art but not their name. When a name is clicked on it brings you to another smaller archive of this artist’s work, and may also have a small biography.
- The Biography tab gives a very detailed history of Haggard’s life and career birth to death. It also addresses some of his problematic views, and explains recurring themes in his writing. 
- The Editor’s Statement is a small essay written by the project director Kate Holterhoff detailing her reasoning behind creating this project, her history with studying Haggard’s works, and what credentials she has to be maintaining this archive. 

While the site is well organized there are some discrepancies between each tab and what they provide readers. For example, there is the master list of illustrators at the top of its tab but the Novels tab doesn't have one. Also, when looking at an illustration via its novel, the description doesn't credit the illustrator. This is a problem because it can create confusion for those who are unfamiliar with Haggard. Leading them to believe he created all these illustrations. 

The descriptions of the images also contain misleading information about their publication. For example, the description of Allan and the Ice Gods talks about the first UK edition published in 1927. Yet, when looking at the different editions, it says that it was first published in 1920.

This lack of clarity also carries over into the descriptions of the Illustrators. There is a varying amount of information for each person. Some have detailed accounts of the person's background and their art. Others have a single line saying where they published their work. Then there are some that do not even have any description, only a link to the picture that they created. This disparity, in combination with the other issues mentioned above, makes the archive seem a little unreliable as a source of historical information.

But the biggest issue I find with this project lies in its accessibility. One of the main purposes of this project is to improve accessibility for the public. But the site does not open on mobile devices. When visiting the site on a mobile browser it is impossible to leave the home screen. The tabs across the top of the page are not there, nor is there any link on the home page itself that leads to the archive. The only function available is the search bar which formats results in a hard-to-read, smushed-together format with no image, and bizarre results that seem to make no sense.

Though this project needs much improvement I believe that it has the potential to become an incredible resource for those interested in Haggard’s work. There is a substantial amount of images related to Haggard’s work and it is clear that Holterhoff is trying hard to make this archive as educational as possible.
